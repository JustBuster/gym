Game Plan: Do atleast 3 consecutive day a week to keep progress. Can do to an upwards to 6 day a week with a rest
day after 3 days. You can have a rest day whenever you want and the good part is you do not have to assign
each day to a week day. If you have a big gap just continue from wherever you left off.

This Routine is a blasphemous amalgamation of classic Push-Pull-Legs (PPL) and the Arnold Split.
The sole reason I made this was to avoid repetion and getting eventually start getting bored.

It is divided into two cycles of Strenght and Hypertrohy, again to keep variation and have consistent
growth. You can choose to focus on one cycle according to you goals.

Keep track of the weight you hit on these exercises and include progressive overload. 

Feel free to include various variations to your wishes, just keep it fun and consistent.

Optional: Can add 10-30 mins of any cardio exercise or routine at the end of each day.
